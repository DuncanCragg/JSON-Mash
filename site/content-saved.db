My name is [Duncan Cragg][http://duncan-cragg.org/blog/], I'm the author of JSON-Mash and the inventor of the [Object Web][http://the-u-web.org] which JSON-Mash helps build.", "The Object Web is a network of interlinked JSON chunks: some pure data, some describing documents like this, some defining page construction, layouts, lists and navigations, and some defining GUIs. There's even a JSON chunking of an Atom feed - demonstrated on the right. Each chunk is called a 'Object', which is short for 'Object Resource'.", "JSON-Mash is an Object Web browser. With a single script, it 'extends' the browser to allow it to navigate the Object Web. The JSON-Mash json-mash-csi.js script builds user interfaces in the browser from the JSON it sees. JSON-Mash can help you build Web-based interactive applications and non-document-oriented applications that have more of a 2D than a linear structure.", "This /[whole page]/ is built from little pieces of JSON - try 'View Source'! For example, take a look at the JSON chunk for [this middle bit of the page][u/owid-123-456.js]. Finally, you can really poke around by turning off the CSS using the '##' link top-left. This will allow you to clearly see the nested Object structure you're viewing. Each Object has a header which includes a widget for viewing its JSON source.", "JSON-Mash is not like other Javascript libraries: you don't write any Javascript! You only author the JSON structures that trigger its functionality. Note that, unlike such technologies as GWT and Volta, JSON-Mash embraces the Web rather than abstracting it away. There's no scary to-Javascript compiler and you can use any server-side stack you like. Like the Web itself, it frees you from silo-thinking, allowing heterogenous, cross-domain browsing and interaction with a 'hyperdata' Web of interactive and animated JSON Objects.", "It's effectively a Web 2.0 browser-within-a-browser, offering all the familiar Web 2.0 technologies and approaches in a single, easy-to-use package: Microformats, semantics (i.e., data not documents), OpenID, social networks, Ajax, DHTML, Comet, REST, Atom and, of course, JSON itself.", "Open the Object below (push the far-right down-arrow) to see the list of benefits of using JSON-Mash and the Object Web:", { "-order-": [ "sub" ], "options": "collapsible objecttitle", "state": "closed", "sub": "owid-123-789" }, "![Roadmap]!", "JSON-Mash is still quite new, and there is plenty more functionality to add, such as more JSON types and client-side mashup or transformation rules. Additional JSON types include more pagination options such as tabs, slideshows and photo galleries. An important addition will be JSON-serialised Microformat support; social networking can be reflected in JSON Object networks of vCard and XFN; Calendar and Geo widgets can animate Objects describing upcoming events. Client-side mashups will allow simple declarative programming executed within the browser over incoming Objects.", "Some of JSON-Mash's functionality depends on server side support - for example, the all-important User Object (with vCard, OpenID and profile/preference data) and Comet push of new Object state. It will also allow the Atom widget to be used to submit new stories and comments. The above upcoming event widget can allow users to add themselves to its list of attendees. Finally, complete GUIs can be built, with all the usual widgets, animated by either client- or server-side rules, templates, queries and searches.", "If you'd like to get involved, contact me (Duncan Cragg) at the email shown on my [blog][http://duncan-cragg.org/blog/].", "![Search Engines and Accessibility]!", "One day, there will be Object Web search engines, but in the meantime your search (and accessibility) needs are met by a server-side proxy that builds static pages from the same Objects. If you have an existing site that can be Object'd apart, you're already there and can have the best of both worlds - old and new! I just added JSON Atom output to my blog, for example (a trivial exercise), to serve the right-hand widget.", "owid-123-abc" ]} } }
